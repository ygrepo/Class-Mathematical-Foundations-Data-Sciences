# Mathematical Tools for Data Science

This course provides a rigorous introduction to mathematical tools for data science drawn from linear algebra, harmonic analysis, probability theory, and convex analysis. The main topics are principal component analysis, linear regression, Fourier analysis, signal representations, sparse models, low-rank models, and dimensionality reduction. The material is motivated by multiple data-analysis applications including signal estimation, collaborative filtering, sound and image processing, magnetic-resonance imaging, sparse regression, and topic modeling.
